  Changelog for "Rainbeau Flambe - Storyteller"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 2020-03-12
    - Updated to 1.1
	- Technical details:
		- The OnOffCycle RaidBeacon was be replaced by ThreatsGenerator.
		- The by-default unconfigured JourneyOffer was replaced by two by-default configured RandomQuests, one for the royalty and one for the non-royalty case.
		- The OnOffCycle WorldQuest was replaced by the abstract GiveQuest.
		As far as I can tell, the above changes should be equivalent between 1.0 and 1.1.
